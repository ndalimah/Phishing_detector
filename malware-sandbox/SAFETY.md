# Safety and lab setup (READ THIS BEFORE RUNNING ANY SAMPLES)

This document records safety guidance for operating a malware analysis sandbox. Follow these rules strictly.

1) Use an isolated VM or dedicated physical machine
- Do NOT run malware on your host OS. Use a disposable VM or dedicated machine with no access to sensitive networks.
- Take a snapshot/backup before each run so you can revert the environment.

2) Network controls
- Redirect or block outbound connections. Use a sinkhole or an instrumented proxy to capture HTTP/DNS traffic.
- If internet access is required for the sample, provide a controlled fake C2 environment.

3) Data handling
- Collect artifacts (PCAP, dropped files, process logs) to a separate analysis storage.
- Never exfiltrate or share raw malware binaries without proper controls and authorization.

4) Legal and policy
- Ensure you have explicit permission to analyze malware in your organization. Follow all laws and policy requirements.

5) Minimal tooling suggestions
- Linux: tcpdump, strace, lsof, procmon-equivalents, sysdig
- Windows: Sysmon, ProcMon, Wireshark, ApateDNS (for DNS sinkholing)

6) Decommissioning
- After analysis revert VM snapshot and securely delete any retained samples.
