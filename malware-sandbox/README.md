# Malware Dynamic Analysis Sandbox

This folder contains a safe scaffold for a malware dynamic analysis sandbox. It is intended as documentation and starter code only — it does NOT execute real malware. The goal is to provide a clear, repeatable lab structure you can extend inside a properly isolated VM.

Contents
- `SAFETY.md` — explicit safety checklist and recommended lab setup
- `runner.py` — a safe demo runner that demonstrates analysis workflow using a harmless sample
- `templates/report_template.md` — report template for analysis results
- `rules/example.yar` — example YARA rule to use in static scanning

Next steps
- Provision an isolated VM (air-gapped or with controlled network), install tooling (tcpdump, strace, sysmon for Windows, etc.), and run the runner inside the VM after adapting it to call your instrumentation.
