# SIEM Lab (Elastic + Kibana)

This folder contains a minimal scaffold for a local SIEM lab using Docker Compose with Elasticsearch + Kibana.

Starter files:
- `docker-compose.yml` - spins up Elasticsearch and Kibana (lightweight settings)
- `ingest/` - placeholder for ingestion scripts and Filebeat configs
- `rules/` - example detection queries and Sigma rules

See `docker-compose.yml` for quick start instructions.
